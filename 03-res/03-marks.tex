\begin{abstract}
    Although evidence of hydrological responses to climate is abundant, the reliable assessments of water yield (WY) over mountainous regions, such as the Upper Brahmaputra River (UBR) basin, remain unclear due to intensified cryospheric changes. 
    Based on multi-station runoff observations, we examine long-term WY changes during 1982--2013 in the UBR basin, and find \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{that }\DIFaddend there are in general hydrological regime shifts in the late 1990s; magnitude increases in WY range from $\sim$10\% to $\sim$80\%, while its directions reverse from \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{upward to downward after the late 1990s}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{the increase to decrease}\DIFaddend .
    Then, the double mass curve (DMC) technique is used to assess the effects of climate, vegetation, and cryosphere on WY changes. Results show that climate and cryosphere together contribute to over 80\% of magnitude increases of WY in the entire UBR basin, in which the role of vegetation is nearly negligible.
    The combined effects, however, are either offsetting or additive, leading to slight or substantial magnitude increases, respectively. 
    Climate change, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{particularly precipitationdecrease }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{mainly decreased precipitation, }\DIFaddend leads to the downward WY trend in recent years, while melt waters under global warming may alleviate the water shortage in some basins. 
    Therefore, the combined effects of climate and cryosphere on WY should be considered in future water resources management over mountainous basins, particularly involving co-benefits between upstream and downstream regions.
\end{abstract}

\introduction
Water yield (\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{or runoff depth, }\DIFaddend WY) in mountainous watersheds is crucial for sustaining fragile ecosystems in headwaters, supplying valuable freshwater resources to downstream lowlands, and balancing co-benefits between upstream and downstream areas, especially for large transboundary river systems \citep{viviroli2011climate}. In mountainous watersheds, WY changes have been commonly, but separately, attributed to climate \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{variability }\DIFaddend \citep{dierauer2018climate,song2021river}, vegetation \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{greening or browning }\DIFaddend \citep{goulden2014mountain,zhou2021divergent}, and glaciers and snow melting \citep{huss2018global, biemans2019importance}. These \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{changes }\DIFaddend are expected to alter the spatial and temporal distribution of water resources \citep{tang2019streamflow} and further threaten water supply and food security downstream \citep{biemans2019importance}. The Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP, see Figure \ref{fig:location}a), which is also known as “Asian Water Tower”, supplies water resources for major rivers in Asia, such as Brahmaputra, Salween, Mekong, Yangtze, Yellow, and Indus Rivers \citep{kang2010review,yao2010glacial,yao2019recent}. As such, WY changes over this region significantly affect the use of water resources, prevention of natural disasters, and protection of aquatic functions for the livelihoods of approximately two billion people \citep{immerzeel2010climate}. While, total river runoff has never been reliably assessed, and its responses to global warming remain unclear, despite some in-situ observations and runoff estimates from state-of-the-art remote sensing technology \citep{wang2021tp}. Therefore, comprehensively assessing \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{the impacts of climate, vegetation, and cryosphere on }\DIFdelend long-term \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{WY changes }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{changes of WY}\DIFaddend , particularly magnitude and direction, is of great importance for the sustainable development of water resources in the  QTP \citep{yao2019recent}. 

In recent years, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{changes in climate, vegetation, and cryosphere have affected WY }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{WY has been significantly affected by multiply factors }\DIFaddend in the QTP. For example, \citet{fan2015temperature} highlighted the important role of precipitation \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{(P) }\DIFaddend in WY increases in the Salween and Mekong River basins. \citet{li2020substantial} found that elevated precipitation and \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{cryosphere changes }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{melt waters }\DIFaddend both contributed to substantial WY increases in the Tuotuo River basin. Similarly, \citet{lutz2014consistent} projected that increased precipitation near the Salween and Mekong Rivers and accelerated meltwater near the Indus River caused significant WY changes. Vegetation \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{has }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{changes have }\DIFaddend also been proven to be vital for mountainous water resources; \citet{li2017grassland} showed that evaporation \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{(E)}\DIFaddend , mostly due to grassland restoration, decreased WY in the Yangtze River basin, while \citet{li2021vegetation} suggested that vegetation greening may change the seasonality of water resources and increase WY during the dry season in the UBR basin.

Although a growing body of evidence has shown that WY is \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{affected by climate, vegetation, and cryosphere }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{experiencing significant changes }\DIFaddend in the QTP, most \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{previous }\DIFaddend studies focus on individual basins, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{and also do not consider these three aspects together. As such, previous results }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{which }\DIFaddend may not fully reveal the spatial variabilities in WY. Of specific interest is the Upper Brahmaputra River (UBR, see Figure \ref{fig:location}\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{a}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{b}\DIFaddend) basin, which covers an area of over 198,636 km$^2$ and has large gradients in elevation, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{climate, and vegetation \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep{li2019spatiotemporal}}\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{thus leading to the elevation-dependent climate and vegetation pattern \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep{li2019spatiotemporal,gao2018does}}\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
}\DIFaddend. Hence, it is imperative to provide a comprehensive, spatially differentiated study \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{considering the effects of climate, vegetation, and cryosphere on }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{on long-term }\DIFaddend WY changes in this region. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{However, studies }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Studies }\DIFaddend of WY changes in the UBR basin\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, however, }\DIFaddend are significantly hindered by the sparse network of hydrological observation stations \citep{li2019spatiotemporal,wang2021tp,yao2019recent}, which leads to large uncertainties in river flow forecasts, and thus water resources assessments. Also, current precipitation estimates are highly uncertain owing to the complex topography of this region, which limits the ability to accurately model the relationships between precipitation and runoff \citep{sun2020precipitation}. Lastly, the present inadequate understanding of hydrological responses to complex interactions among \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{climate, vegetation, and cryosphere }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{multi-spheres }\DIFaddend limits the application of hydrological models in these mountainous watersheds \citep{pellicciotti2012challenges}. While, long-term observed runoff records and recent high-resolution precipitation \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{datasets give a pathway for using statistical methods }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{data in the UBR basin provide a valuable opportunity }\DIFaddend to estimate runoff responses to warming \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{in the UBR basin}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{by statistical methods}\DIFaddend . 

\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Hence}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Therefore}\DIFaddend , this study \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{here jointly assesses }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{use the Double Mass Curve (DMC) technique to jointly assess }\DIFaddend historical WY responses to climate warming and associated environmental changes in the UBR basin. To do this, we collect multi-station runoff observations and detect long-term WY changes during 1982--2013\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{in the UBR basin}\DIFdelend . And then, we use \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{the double mass curve (DMC ) }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{DMC method }\DIFaddend to estimate the effects of climate \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, vegetation}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{that is indicated by effective precipitation (P-E, eP), vegetation (represented by Leaf Area Index, LAI)}\DIFaddend , and cryosphere \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{(e.g. melt waters from glaciers and snow) }\DIFaddend on magnitude and direction changes in WY \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{(See Data and Methods)}\DIFaddend . This study is expected to provide essential information for water resources management in the UBR basin and other mountainous watersheds. 

\section{Data and Methods}

\subsection{Study area}
The Brahmaputra River (known as the Yarlung Zangbo River, or YZR, in China), a transboundary river in the southern QTP, originates in the Gyama Langdzom Glacier and flows across China, India, and Bangladesh, before emptying into the Indian Ocean. The UBR basin is located above the Nuxia hydrological station (Figure \ref{fig:location}\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{a}\DIFdelend ), and its river flow has significant implications on freshwater resources of South Asia. 
Here, we divide the UBR basin into the headstream (HYZR), upstream (UYZR), midstream (MYZR), downstream (LYZR), Nianchu River (NCR), and Lhasa River (LSR) basins by the locations of hydrological stations (Table \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{\ref{tab: table 1} }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{\ref{tab:my-table} }\DIFaddend and Figure \ref{fig:location}b).

The elevation gradient and the distance to the ocean in the UBR basin together contribute to a large spatial variability in climate \citep{sang2016precipitation}. The annual precipitation in the HYZR basin is less than 400 mm, while that in the LYZR basin is nearly 1000 mm, and similarly, the annual \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{actual }\DIFdelend evaporation increases gradually from upstream to downstream areas (Figure \ref{figS:climate means}a+b). Meanwhile, water and energy availability modulate vegetation conditions \citep{li2019greening}; vegetation cover increases dramatically from the HYZR to the LYZR basin (Figure \ref{figS:climate means}c). Additionally, cryospheric meltwater due to atmospheric warming has substantially altered hydrology conditions in this region \citep{cuo2019warming,yao2010glacial,wang2021tp}.

\subsection{\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Dataset}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Data}\DIFaddend }
Here we collect \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{multi-station }\DIFaddend annual runoff observations from 1982 to 2013 and convert the river flow (\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{$m^{3}/s$}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{m$^{3}$/s}\DIFaddend ) into runoff depth (\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{$mm$}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{mm}\DIFaddend ). Also, we acquire high-resolution climate and vegetation data in the same time range, and further aggregate these gridded data into regional annual values by considering area-weighted effects (their temporal changes are shown in Figure \ref{figS:time series}).

\subsubsection{Runoff data}
Annual runoff \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{data }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{observations }\DIFaddend between 1982 and 2013 used here come from six hydrological stations along the mainstream and major branches in the UBR basin. WY in the HYZR is equal to runoff depth at Lhatse station, while WY in other basins is calculated by the difference between runoff depth from the downstream station and that from the upstream and branch stations. For example, WY in the MYZR basin is equal to the difference between runoff depth in Yangcun station and that in Lhasa and Nugesha stations (Figure \ref{fig:location}b).

\subsubsection{Climate data}
The most recent \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{10x10 }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{10 }\DIFaddend km gridded daily precipitation data, combining topographic and linear correction approaches based on 262 rain-gauge observations, is developed for the UBR basin by \citet{sun2020precipitation} and here used to estimate regional annual precipitation (P). The maximum 2 m air temperature is obtained from China Meteorological Forcing Dataset \citep{he2020first}. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Regional actual evaporation (AET}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{The evaporation (E}\DIFaddend ) with a 0.25$^{\circ}$ spatial resolution is acquired from Global Land Evaporation Amsterdam Model (GLEAM) \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD

\subsubsection{Vegetation data}
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{The leaf area index }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Leaf Area Index }\DIFaddend (LAI) used in this study is obtained from Global Inventory Monitoring and Modelling System (GIMMS) LAI3g with a spatial resolution of 8 \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{×8 }\DIFdelend km \citep{zhu2013global}. The product is generated using an artificial neural network trained on the Collection Terra Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) LAI product and the latest version of GIMMS NDVI3g data for the same period, which has been proven to have an improved multi-sensor record harmonization scheme compared to other global LAI products \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD

}\DIFaddend. 

\subsubsection{Land use and cover}
The land use and cover in 2000 with a spatial resolution of \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{1x1 }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{1 }\DIFaddend km is used to represent the land cover types in the UBR basin. The data is acquired from Resource and Environmental Science Data Center, and is here divided into seven primary land use types, including cultivated land, forestland, grassland, water body, urban land, unused land, and glaciers and snow (Figure \ref{figS:lucc}).
%DIF < The data is developed by the land-use dynamic regionalization method based on land survey data and LANDSAT TM/ETM remote sensing images \citep{liu2014spatiotemporal}.

\subsection{Methodology}
\subsubsection{Trend and abruption analysis}
In this study, we use the non-parametric Mann--Kendall test \citep{kendall1938new,mann1945nonparametric} to identify the trend in WY, and Pettitt abrupt detection \citep{pettitt1979non} to identify the turning point (\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{TP}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Tp}\DIFaddend ) in WY, where the level of significance is set at 0.05. \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{The Pettitt method has the advantages of the non-parametric, rank-based and distribution-free for finding the abrupt variation in a time series. }\DIFaddend We then compare the averages of WY before and after \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{the TP }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Tp }\DIFaddend to reflect the magnitude changes, and compare the trends in two periods to reflect the direction changes.

\subsubsection{Double mass curve technique}
The DMC used here is a plot of the cumulative data of one variable versus the cumulative data of another related variable in a concurrent period. It has previously been used to assess the individual effect of climate \citep{gao2011changes}, forest disturbance \citep{wei2010quantifying}, wildfire \citep{hallema2018burned}, and cryosphere \citep{brahney2017determining} on water resources. For the large and pristine UBR and other mountainous basins, climate, vegetation, and cryosphere (melt waters from glaciers and snow under warming, see \citealt{biemans2019importance,huss2018global}) play important roles in hydrology, and these three parts must be together considered to accurately estimate hydrological responses to warming. It is considerably hard to directly calculate the supply of melt waters to WY due to the lack of long-term glacier monitoring, while runoff observations and high-resolution climate and vegetation data make it possible to use the DMC technique, a data-driven statistical method, to estimate cryospheric contributions to WY.  

The selection of climate and vegetation indices used in the DMC technique is an important issue. Previous studies have shown that effective precipitation (\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{eP, P-AET}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{P-E, eP}\DIFaddend ) can reflect more information of climate on WY compared with individual P or \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{AET}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{E}\DIFaddend , and be regarded as a reliable proxy to climate \citep{wei2010quantifying,zhang2019separating}. LAI quantifies the amount of leaf area in an ecosystem and becomes an important variable reflecting vegetation structures and biophysical processes \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep{fang2019overview, forzieri2020increased}}\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep{forzieri2020increased}}\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
}\DIFaddend , and \citet{li2021vegetation} has used LAI to investigate vegetation effects on seasonal hydrology in the UBR basin. Hence, we consider eP and LAI as the indices of climate and vegetation respectively, and use their time series as the inputs in the DMC model. 

To obtain cryospheric contributions to WY, we firstly build two types of DMC plots (see Figure \ref{figS:DMC}) to assess the contributions of climate (eP) and vegetation (LAI), and then subtract the sum of estimated contributions from total WY deviations as cryospheric effects (results are shown in Figure \ref{fig:attribution-results}). The \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{schematic diagram Figure \ref{fig:example_DMC} and associated mathematical formulas}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{mathematical formulas, relevant descriptions and an example (Figure \ref{fig:example_DMC}) }\DIFaddend are shown as follows:

\end{figure*}\DIFaddend 

First, the \DIFadd{averaged WY before Tp ($\overline{WY_{ob}}$, horizontal black line in Figure \ref{fig:example_DMC}b) is defined as:}

\begin{equation}
    \color{blue} \overline{WY_{ob}} = \frac{\sum_{t=1982}^{t=Tp}WY_o(t)} {Tp-1982+1}
\end{equation}

\DIFadd{Next, the }total WY deviation ($\Delta WY_s(t)$, black diamond in Figure \ref{fig:example_DMC}c) can be calculated as the difference between WY \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{after a TP }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{observations after Tp }\DIFaddend ($WY_o(t)$, red point in Figure \ref{fig:example_DMC}b) and the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{average WY before that TP ($\frac{\sum_{t=1}^{t=tp}WY_o(t)} {tp}$, horizontal black line in Figure \ref{fig:example_DMC}b}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{averaged WY before Tp ($\overline{WY_{ob}}$}\DIFaddend), as follows:

\begin{equation} 
    \Delta WY_s(t)=WY_o(t)-\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{\frac{\sum_{t=1}^{t=tp} WY_o(t)}{tp}}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \overline{WY_{ob}}\DIFaddend , \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{\ \  }\DIFaddend t=\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{tp}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Tp}\DIFaddend +1, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{tp}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Tp}\DIFaddend +2, \ldots, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{32
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{2013
}\DIFaddend \end{equation}

Second, the regression equation (left panel in Figure \ref{fig:example_DMC}a) between the cumulative eP ($\sum eP$) and cumulative WY ($\sum WY$) before \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{a TP }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Tp }\DIFaddend can be constructed as follows:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:2}
    \sum WY = a_1\sum eP + b_1
\end{equation} 

Similarly, the regression equation (right panel in Figure \ref{fig:example_DMC}a) between the cumulative LAI ($\sum LAI$) and cumulative water yield ($\sum WY$) before a \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{TP }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Tp }\DIFaddend can be constructed as follows:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:3}
    \sum WY = a_2\sum LAI + b_2
\end{equation}

Third, WY driven by climate ($WY_c(t)$, blue line in Figure \ref{fig:example_DMC}b) can be calculated by inputting the cumulative eP after \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{a TP }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Tp }\DIFaddend into Equation \ref{eq:2} \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{that is built based on the cumulative data of WY and eP before Tp}\DIFaddend . Therefore, WY \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{deviation }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{deviations }\DIFaddend caused by climate change ($\Delta WY_c(t)$, blue bar in Figure \ref{fig:example_DMC}c) can be calculated as follows:
\begin{equation}
    \Delta WY_{c}(t)=WY_{c}(t)-\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{\frac{\sum_{t=1}^{t=tp}WY_o(t)}{tp}}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \overline{WY_{ob}}\DIFaddend , \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{\ \  }\DIFaddend t=\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{tp}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Tp}\DIFaddend +1, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{tp}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Tp}\DIFaddend +2, \ldots, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{32
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{2013
}\DIFaddend \end{equation}

Similarly, WY driven by vegetation ($WY_v(t)$, tan line in Figure \ref{fig:example_DMC}b) can be calculated via Equation \ref{eq:3}, and WY deviation caused by vegetation ($\Delta WY_v$, tan bar in Figure \ref{fig:example_DMC}c) can be calculated as follows:
\begin{equation}
    \Delta WY_{v}(t)=WY_{v}(t)-\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{\frac{\sum_{t=1}^{t=tp}WY_o(t)}{tp}}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \overline{WY_{ob}}\DIFaddend , \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{\ \ }\DIFaddend t=\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{tp}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Tp}\DIFaddend +1, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{tp}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Tp}\DIFaddend +2, \ldots, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{32
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{2013
}\DIFaddend \end{equation}

Finally, WY deviation caused by cryosphere ($\Delta WY_g$, red bar in Figure \ref{fig:example_DMC}c) can be calculated as:
\begin{equation}
    \Delta WY_{g}(t)=\Delta WY_s(t)-\Delta WY_{c}(t)-\Delta WY_{v}(t)
\end{equation}

    \end{split}\DIFaddend 
\end{equation}

The relative contribution ($RC$), ranging from 0 to 1, of climate, vegetation, and cryosphere can be calculated as follows:
\begin{equation}
    \begin{split}
        RC_{c}=\frac{\left|\overline{\Delta WY_{c}}\right|}{\left|\overline{\Delta WY_{c}}\right|+\left|\overline{\Delta WY_{v}}\right|+\mid \overline{\Delta WY_{g} \mid}}\\

    \end{split}
\end{equation}

Additionally, we use the Pearson correlation coefficient ($r$) to quantify the relationships between total WY deviation ($\Delta WY_s(t)$) and its components: WY deviation caused by climate ($\Delta WY_c(t)$), vegetation ($\Delta WY_v(t)$) and cryosphere ($\Delta WY_g(t)$). The Student's t-test \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{with the Bonferroni correction \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD

\section{Results}
\subsection{Long-term changes in historical water yield}
The detection of long-term WY changes from 1982 to 2013 in the entire UBR basin is illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:water-yield}. There is a great spatial variability in WY (Figure \ref{fig:water-yield}a). The mean WY is the highest in the LYZR basin (over 600 mm), followed by that in the LSR basin (nearly 400 mm). However, the mean WY in the HYZR and NCR basins is less than 100 mm. This spatial variability is consistent with that of precipitation (Figure \ref{figS:P-and-WY}), which is mainly determined by elevation and distance to the ocean \citep{sang2016precipitation}. In addition, WY generally increases during the period, as shown by the positive slope in Figure \ref{fig:water-yield}b, although the significant trend is only detected in the UYZR and MYZR basins (hatched areas in Figure \ref{fig:water-yield}b). \DIFdelbegin %DIFDELCMD <

\DIFdel{We then use the Pettitt method to identify the TP in WY. The TP }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Tp }\DIFaddend mainly occurs during the late 1990s (Figure \ref{fig:water-yield}c), but the abrupt change detected in some basins is not statistically significant (Table \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{\ref{tab: table 1}}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{\ref{tab:my-table}}\DIFaddend ). Similarly, the cumulative anomaly curve (Figure \ref{fig:water-yield}d) shows that WY decreases prior to the late 1990s and then increases in the entire UBR basin, which further supports the results obtained from the Pettitt method.

\end{figure*}

\subsection{Regime shifts in historical water yield}
Based on the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{TP}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{results of the abrupt detection}\DIFaddend , we divide the period from 1982 to 2013 into before and after \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{TP periods}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Tp period}\DIFaddend , and analyze the magnitude and direction changes in WY in the entire UBR basin. Figure \ref{fig:magnitude-direction}a shows that WY increases from 9.5 to 130.9 mm, with a high spatial variability. The slight increase observed in the HYZR and LYZR basins accounts for less than 10\% of the mean WY before \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{the TP}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Tp}\DIFaddend , while a substantial WY increase of 61.6\% and 80.5\% is found in the UYZR and MYZR basins, respectively. In addition, a higher variation is detected after \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{TP}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Tp}\DIFaddend , suggesting a more dramatic variability in recent years.

For the direction changes in WY, we find that the trend is positive before \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{the TP, but become }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Tp, but becomes }\DIFaddend negative afterward in most basins (Figure \ref{fig:magnitude-direction}b and \ref{figS:time series}). The significantly decreasing trend is detected in the UYZR, NCR, and LSR basins. In contrast, although the WY in the MYZR basin increases during two periods, the rate has slowed, as the positive trend after \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{the TP }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Tp }\DIFaddend (3.64 mm yr$^{−1}$, p > 0.05) is less than that before \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{the TP }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Tp }\DIFaddend (8.95 mm yr$^{−1}$, p < 0.05). Overall, WY regime shifts occur in the late 1990s in the entire UBR basin; the magnitude generally increases, but the direction of WY has reversed or slowed.

\end{figure*}

\subsection{Attribution analysis on magnitude increases in water yield}
As shown in Figure \ref{fig:attribution-magnitude}, we quantify the contributions from climate (eP), vegetation (LAI), and cryosphere on WY magnitude increases in the entire UBR basin. We find that cryosphere changes, on average, contribute to over half of WY increases in the HYZR, UYZR, NCR, and MYZR basins. However, climate plays a more important role in WY magnitude increases in the LSR and LYZR basins, with average relative contributions of 55.4\% and 46.0\%, respectively. In contrast to the dominant roles of climate and cryosphere, vegetation has a consistently positive contribution to WY increases, although its relative contribution is much less than those from climate and cryosphere.

Climate and cryosphere -- two important factors affecting WY -- together contribute to over 80\% average magnitude increases of WY in the entire UBR basin; however, they play both additive or offsetting roles \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{in different basins }\DIFaddend (Figure \ref{fig:attribution-magnitude}) \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, resulting }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{and thus result }\DIFaddend in slight or substantial WY increases (Figure \ref{fig:magnitude-direction}a). For example, although cryospheric \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{loss contributes }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{changes contribute }\DIFaddend to average increases of 28.3 mm and 30.3 mm in the HYZR and NCR basins (black "x" \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{signals }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{signal }\DIFaddend in Figure \ref{fig:attribution-magnitude}a+c), the negative contributions from climate offset a considerable part of these increases, leading to slight increases after \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{the TP }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Tp }\DIFaddend in these regions. Similarly, the positive contribution from climate offsets the negative contribution from cryosphere in the LSR and LYZR basins, which also results in a slight \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{mean }\DIFdelend WY increase. In addition, the additive effects from climate and cryosphere lead to substantial increases in WY from 162.6 mm to 293.5 mm in the MYZR basin and from 164.9 mm to 266.5 mm in the UYZR basin (Figure \ref{fig:magnitude-direction}a).

\end{figure*}

\subsection{Attribution analysis on direction shifts in water yield}
Pearson \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{’s }\DIFdelend correlation coefficient is applied to determine the role of climate, vegetation, and cryosphere in the reversed or slowed WY \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{trend after the TP}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{trends after Tp}\DIFaddend , as shown in Figure \ref{fig:magnitude-direction}b. Results in Figure \ref{fig:attribution-direction} show that, although the correlation varies greatly across basins ranging from 0.11 to 0.93 after \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{the TP}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Tp}\DIFaddend , climate typically is positively associated with total WY, in which the correlation is significant in half of basins (p < 0.05), again revealing the major role of climate in the hydrological trends in the entire UBR basin. Further analysis shows that, precipitation is much more important, because it exhibits the stronger reverse in trend compared with that in \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{actual }\DIFdelend evaporation (Figure \ref{figS:climate-directions}), which is also similar with direction changes in WY (Figure \ref{fig:magnitude-direction}b). Additionally, despite the weak contribution of vegetation (Figure \ref{fig:attribution-magnitude}), its positive role in WY changes is more apparent in the drier basins (such as \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{the HYZR, }\DIFaddend UYZR and NCR \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{basins}\DIFaddend ), while the correlation is negative in the relatively humid LYZR basin.

The fitting line and its 95\% confidence interval are shown only when p value $<$ 0.05. \DIFdelbeginFL \DIFdelFL{$n$ }\DIFdelendFL \DIFaddbeginFL \DIFaddFL{n }\DIFaddendFL indicates the number of years after \DIFdelbeginFL \DIFdelFL{the TP}\DIFdelendFL \DIFaddbeginFL \DIFaddFL{Tp}\DIFaddendFL , which is determined by the Pettitt method (See Table \DIFdelbeginFL \DIFdelFL{\ref{tab: table 1} }\DIFdelendFL \DIFaddbeginFL \DIFaddFL{\ref{tab:my-table} }\DIFaddendFL and Figure \ref{fig:water-yield}c).}
    \label{fig:attribution-direction}
\end{figure*}

In contrast to positive contributions of climate, we find that WY caused by cryosphere exhibits a negative association with reduced total WY deviations in recent years in the UYZR (r = -0.39, p > 0.05) and LSR (r = -0.36, p > 0.05) basins. The negative but weak relationship indicates that melt waters from cryospheric loss may compensate for low flow, and even mitigate water shortage risks. Also, the compensating effect from cryosphere is much stronger in the MYZR (r = 0.47, p > 0.05), and together with climate contributions, contributes to the increasing WY trend (Figure \ref{fig:magnitude-direction}). Different from other regions, however, the HYZR basin shows a significantly positive relationship between cryospheric contributions and total WY deviations (r = 0.76, p < 0.05), indicating that cryosphere instead of climate leads to the downward trend in headwaters. This signifies that in this region, cryospheric contributions \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{may }\DIFaddend have already passed a maximum supplying to river flow, due to decreased glaciers and snow under continuous warming. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{The }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{This }\DIFaddend is further verified by the relationship of cryospheric contributions to total WY ($RC_g$) with temperature (Figure \ref{figS:warming-and-cryosphere}\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{). 
In the HYZR basin, WY resulting from the cryosphere continues to increase with temperature }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{a); cryospheric contribution to WY increases with temperature firstly }\DIFaddend until a maximum is reached, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{beyond which cryospheric contribution to total WY }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{and then }\DIFaddend begins to decrease. In addition, the compensating effect of melt waters can be seen \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{clearly }\DIFdelend in the UYZR, MYZR and LSR basins, i.e., WY caused by cryospheric \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{loss }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{changes }\DIFaddend keeps a positive relationship with the increase of temperature, further supporting the higher correlation in these basins (Figure \ref{fig:attribution-direction}).

\section{Discussion}
\subsection{Climate and cryosphere cause water yield regime shifts}
Previous studies have indicated the increasing WY trend in the LSR \citep{linhess2020}, LYZR \citep{zhangech2011}, and UBR basins \citep{li2021vegetation}. Here, we not only provide further evidence on the long-term trend of WY changes in the above regions, but also conduct trend analysis in other regions that received less attention in the present. As such, the study comprehensively indicates a general increase in WY (Figure \ref{fig:water-yield}a) in the entire UBR basin. Further, we find that WY regime shifts occur during the late 1990s in the entire UBR basin -- the magnitude in WY increases (Figure \ref{fig:magnitude-direction}a), but the direction has reversed or slowed after \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{the TP }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Tp }\DIFaddend (Figure \ref{fig:magnitude-direction}b). The result agrees with climate shifts (Figure \ref{figS:time series}), drought changes \citep{li2019spatiotemporal} in the UBR basin, and lake area changes in the Tibetan Plateau \citep{zhang2017}.

Attribution analysis on WY magnitude shifts gives an emphasis on the dependency of spatial gradients of climate and cryosphere accounting for WY changes. That is, climate explains a greater increase in WY in downstream regions, while melt water is more important in upstream regions (Figure \ref{fig:attribution-magnitude}). 
This may be attributed to divergent water supply sources; \citet{biemans2019importance} indicates that melt waters supply over 40\% of river flow in the upper regions, but the contribution is less than 30\% in the downstream in the UBR basin (Figure \ref{figS:Biemans}). Vegetation here does not significantly affect total river flow in the UBR (Figure \ref{fig:attribution-magnitude}), despite its remarkable role in seasonal runoff detected by \citet{li2021vegetation}. 

Climate, especially precipitation, still \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{control }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{controls }\DIFaddend the declining WY trend after \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{the TP }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Tp }\DIFaddend in most regions (Figure \ref{fig:attribution-direction} and \ref{figS:climate-directions}), \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{and }\DIFaddend may become an important factor in occurrence of turning points (Figure \ref{fig:water-yield}c+d). This suggests the importance of precipitation and its projections on future hydrological process in mountainous watersheds \citep{lutz2014consistent}. Cryospheric contribution is also important for water yield regime shifts -- melt waters from glaciers and snow \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{melting }\DIFdelend can alleviate water resources shortages, mainly caused by decreased precipitation in recent years (Figure \ref{fig:attribution-direction}+\ref{figS:climate-directions}). This finding is also supported by observed glacier runoff data \citep{yao2010glacial} and several modeling studies \citep{lutz2014consistent, Zhang2020VariationOM, wang2021tp}. However, after glacier runoff reaches a maximum, defined as "peak water" \citep{gleick2010peak}, cryospheric mass loss cannot sustain the rising melt waters with atmospheric warming (e.g. the HYZR basin in Figure \ref{figS:warming-and-cryosphere}), which is in agreement with \citet{huss2018global}. 

\subsection{Uncertainties and limitations}
%%%%%%%%% Method Limitations 
This study has some limitations regarding the DMC model to partition the effects of climatic and cryospheric changes on the hydrological regime shifts in the UBR basin. The DMC method is a useful alternative statistical method to physical modeling approaches, especially in alpine river basins (e.g. UBR basin) where there is less knowledge on the complex hydrological mechanisms. While the method is still dependent on our prior understanding of hydrological responses to warming and related environmental changes, such as glaciers melting and vegetation \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{greening}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{changes}\DIFaddend . For the UBR basin, besides climate change, cryosphere \citep{biemans2019importance,yao2019recent} and vegetation \citep{li2021vegetation,li2019greening} are two major factors for hydrological changes, and the cryospheric contributions can be regarded as the deviations between total water yield and climate and vegetation contributions estimated by the DMC method. While, in some \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{other }\DIFaddend mountainous basins, human activities, such as urbanization, dam regulation and irrigation, may consume severely water \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{resource }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{resources }\DIFaddend or change seasonal runoff patterns\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, and thus we have }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{; thus it is necessary }\DIFaddend to consider anthropogenic impacts \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{into the DMC statistical model for river flow attribution. 
On the other hand}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{when assess river flow changes via the statistical models in these regions. In addition}\DIFaddend , the DMC method applies the linear assumption between two variables, and thus it may fail to capture some nonlinear process among \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{the interactions among wateryield}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{water}\DIFaddend , vegetation and cryospheric melting\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{in the study}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{. For example, the role of vegetation in hydrological process is expected to be complex due to biophysical (e.g., via transpiration and albedo changes) and biochemical (e.g., via CO2 uptake and release) feedbacks (\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citealt{bonan2008forests,krich2022decoupling}}\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
)}\DIFaddend . Thus, with the availability of long-term in-situ observations and high-resolution remote sensing datasets in the UBR basin \citep{wang2022observing}, other powerful statistical models considering nonlinear and casual structures should be applied to identify the causes of water yield changes \citep{runge2019inferring}.

%%%%%%%%% Data Limitations 
The data used in the study may also give rise to some uncertainties for our results. The \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{10x10 km }\DIFdelend precipitation product used here is generated by topographical and linear corrections based on observations. As \citet{sun2020precipitation} pointed, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{while, }\DIFdelend the results of the linear correction approach highly vary with the station density. For example, the increased numbers from 4 to 10 stations in the basin will decrease the mean annual precipitation by about 20 mm. Hence, the reconstruction of precipitation dataset will rely on the density of the observed stations. Besides the topographic correction, the effects of the basin size and climate seasonality should be considered in the work of precipitation reconstruction in the UBR basin due to the complex climate and environment \citep{sun2019contrasting}. Compared with precipitation, the estimation of evaporation may be much more challenging in high mountains. Although GLEAM \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{actual }\DIFdelend evaporation shows the good agreement with in-situ eddy covariance records \citep{yang2017multi}, its model structure does not include wind speed and solar radiation, which may affect the estimation of sublimation, and thus total evaporation \citep{li2019evapotranspiration}. 
In addition, the coarse spatial resolution with a 0.25$^{\circ}$ spatial resolution in GLEAM may be insufficient to estimate regional evaporation in the UBR basin.
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{However, with }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{GIMMS LAI has the advantage of capturing ecosystem structure, and thus is widely used to assess vegetation conditions and their effects on hydrological changes \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD

indicates that LAI can cope with hydro-climatic fluctuations in arid environments, while the tradeoff between ecosystem structure (LAI) and physiology (photosynthesis per unit leaf area) becomes stronger in humid climates. Thus, using LAI products in energy-limited regions may result in some biased assessments of vegetation effects on water yield.
Although uncertainties in terms of the method and data used here, this study provides the essential information for water resource management in the UBR basin and the downstream based on the multi-station runoff observations. With }\DIFaddend the help of the Second Tibetan Plateau Scientific Expedition and Research, the observation networks in meteorology, cryosphere and hydrology will be built, which is expected to \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{benefit reliable precipitation and evaporation estimation}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{better understand hydrological process in this region}\DIFaddend , and make developing physically-based cryosphere-hydrological modeling possible \citep{wang2022observing}.

\subsection{Broad Implications for mountainous water management}
Understanding the hydrological regime shifts and their causes in \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{the }\DIFdelend high mountains are especially important in managing water resources, especially balancing the co-benefits between mountains and downstream lowlands \citep{viviroli2011climate}. In the study, the combined (offsetting or additive) effects from climate and cryosphere are detected (Figure \ref{fig:attribution-magnitude}), and further lead to either slight or substantial increases in WY in the entire UBR basin (Figure \ref{fig:magnitude-direction}a). The combined effects often hinder the roles of each driver in hydrological changes \citep{wei2018,zhang2021deforestation}, which should be considered when designing water management strategies in the large transboundary river system. For example, the additive effect may be beneficial for mitigating droughts and water shortage during droughts, but it may exacerbate the flood risks due to increased precipitation and accelerated melting of the cryosphere in the future \citep{Immerzeel2013}. In addition, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{our results clearly }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{in the headwaters, WY resulting from the cryosphere continues to increase with temperature until a maximum is reached, beyond which cryospheric contribution to total WY begins to decrease (Figure \ref{figS:warming-and-cryosphere}a), which may }\DIFaddend show that the melt waters from glaciers \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{might }\DIFdelend have already surpassed the "peak water"\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{(Figure \ref{figS:warming-and-cryosphere}), and the associated }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{. The }\DIFaddend hydrological changes will substantially affect future water resources management\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{. Thus, }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, and thus }\DIFaddend the projections of the occurrence time of "peak water" will be important in managing mountainous water resources.

\conclusions 
In this study, regime shifts in WY are detected during the late 1990s in the UBR basin. The WY magnitude generally increases, but its direction has reversed or slowed in recent years. Attribution analysis based on the DMC method shows that, the combined effects of climate and cryosphere are either offsetting or additive, leading to slight or substantial WY increases, while the role of vegetation is much weaker. The declining or slowing WY trend after \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{the TP }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Tp }\DIFaddend is mainly driven by climate in most regions, while melt waters may alleviate drought and water shortage. In headwaters, however, cryospheric contributions to WY have declined due to reduced glaciers under warming. These findings suggest that the combined effects of climate and cryosphere should be considered in the sustainable development of water resources, especially involving \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{with }\DIFdelend co-benefits in upstream and downstream regions.
